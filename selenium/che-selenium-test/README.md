How to run Selenium tests
------------------

#### 1. Register OAuth application 

Go to [OAuth application page](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) and register a new application:
* `Application name` : `Che`
* `Homepage URL` : `http://<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS><:YOUR_CHE_PORT>`
* `Application description` : `Che`
* `Authorization callback URL` : `http://<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS><:YOUR_CHE_PORT>/api/oauth/callback`

Substitute `CHE_OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENTID` and `CHE_OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENTSECRET` properties in `che.env` with `Client ID` and `Client Secret` taken from 
newly created [OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/developers).

#### 2. Add configuration file

Set `CHE_LOCAL_CONF_DIR` environment variable and point to the folder where selenium tests configuration will be stored.
Create file `selenium.properties` in that folder with the following content:
```
# Credentials of Eclipse Che multiuser assemblies
che.admin_user.email=<CHE_ADMIN_EMAIL>
che.admin_user.password=<CHE_ADMIN_PASSWORD>

che.test_user.email=<CHE_USER_EMAIL>
che.test_user.password=<CHE_USER_PASSWORD>

# GitHub account credentials
github.username=<MAIN_GITHUB_USERNAME>
github.password=<MAIN_GITHUB_PASSWORD>
github.auxiliary.username=<AUXILIARY_GITHUB_USERNAME>
github.auxiliary.password=<AUXILIARY_GITHUB_PASSWORD>

# Google account credentials (IMAP has to be enabled)
google.user=<GOOGLE_USER>
google.password=<GOOGLE_PASSWORD>
```

#### 3. Prepare repository 
Fork all repositories from [https://github.com/idexmai?tab=repositories](https://github.com/idexmai?tab=repositories) into the main GitHub account.
Fork the repository [https://github.com/iedexmain1/pull-request-plugin-fork-test](https://github.com/iedexmain1/pull-request-plugin-fork-test) into the auxiliary GitHub account.

#### 4. Start Eclipse Che

Follow the guide: [https://github.com/eclipse/che](https://github.com/eclipse/che)

#### 5. Run tests

Simply launch `./selenium-tests.sh`

### How to run tests on OpenShift
#### Che in container case
##### 1. Set workspace runtime infrastructure implementation
export CHE_SELENIUM_INFRASTRUCTURE=openshift
##### 2. Run tests in the default way
Simply launch `./selenium-tests.sh`
#### Che inside of OpenShift case
##### 1. Set workspace runtime infrastructure implementation
export CHE_SELENIUM_INFRASTRUCTURE=openshift
##### 2. Run tests and specify host and port of Che deployed to OpenShift
Launch `./selenium-tests.sh --host=<Che host on openshift> --port=80`

Example: `./selenium-tests.sh --host=che-spi.192.168.99.100.nip.io --port=80`

Run tests configuration properties
--------------------------------------
```
Usage: ./selenium-tests.sh [-Mmode] [options] [tests scope]

Options:
    --http                              Use 'http' protocol to connect to product
    --https                             Use 'https' protocol to connect to product
    --host=<PRODUCT_HOST>               Set host where product is deployed
    --port=<PRODUCT_PORT>               Set port of the product, default is 8080
    --multiuser                         Run tests of Multi User Che

Modes (defines environment to run tests):
    -Mlocal                             All tests will be run in a Web browser on the developer machine.
                                        Recommended if test visualization is needed and for debugging purpose.

        Options that go with 'local' mode:
        --web-driver-version=<VERSION>  To use the specific version of the WebDriver, be default the latest will be used: 2.30
        --web-driver-port=<PORT>        To run WebDriver on the specific port, by default: 9515
        --threads=<THREADS>             Number of tests that will be run simultaneously. It also means the very same number of
                                        Web browsers will be opened on the developer machine.
                                        Default value is in range [2,5] and depends on available RAM.

    -Mgrid (default)                    All tests will be run in parallel among several docker containers.
                                        One container per thread. Recommended to run test suite.

        Options that go with 'grid' mode:
            --threads=<THREADS>         Number of tests that will be run simultaneously.
                                        Default value is in range [2,5] and depends on available RAM.

Define tests scope:
    --test=<TEST_CLASS>                 Single test to run
    --suite=<SUITE>                     Test suite to run, found:
                                            * CheSuite.xml

Handle failing tests:
    --failed-tests                      Rerun failed tests that left after the previous try
    --regression-tests                  Rerun regression tests that left after the previous try
    --rerun [ATTEMPTS]                  Automatically rerun failing tests.
                                        Default attempts number is 1.
    --compare-with-ci [BUILD NUMBER]    Compare failed tests with results on CI server.
                                        Default build is the latest.

Other options:
    --debug                             Run tests in debug mode
    --skip-sources-validation           Fast build. Skips source validation and enforce plugins
    --workspace-pool-size=[<SIZE>|auto] Size of test workspace pool.
                                        Default value is 0, that means that test workspaces are created on demand.

HOW TO of usage:
    Test Eclipse Che single user assembly:
        ./selenium-tests.sh

    Test Eclipse Che multi user assembly:
        ./selenium-tests.sh --multiuser

    Test Eclipse Che assembly and automatically rerun failing tests:
        ./selenium-tests.sh --rerun [ATTEMPTS]

    Run single test or package of tests:
        ./selenium-tests.sh <...> --test=<TEST>

    Run suite:
        ./selenium-tests.sh <...> --suite=<PATH_TO_SUITE>

    Rerun failed tests:
        ./selenium-tests.sh <...> --failed-tests
        ./selenium-tests.sh <...> --failed-tests --rerun [ATTEMPTS]

    Debug selenium test:
        ./selenium-tests.sh -Mlocal --test=<TEST> --debug

    Analyse tests results:
        ./selenium-tests.sh --compare-with-ci [BUILD NUMBER]
```
